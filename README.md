# Frontend Application Design Course

The objective of this course is to introduce new developers to the technologies and techniques for building and 
deploying a modern single page web application from the ground up.  The course focuses heavily on software engineering 
principles using modern frameworks as enablers rather than crutches.  

Chapters 1 through 4 introduce core concepts of application frameworks but without the frameworks. Once the foundations are laid, chapters 5 through 8 rewrite the application with React.
