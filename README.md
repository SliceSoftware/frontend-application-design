# Frontend Application Design Course

The objective of this course is to introduce new developers to the technologies and techniques for building and 
deploying a modern single page web application from the ground up.  The course focuses heavily on software engineering 
principles using modern frameworks as enablers rather than crutches.  

Chapters 1 through 3 introduce core concepts of application frameworks but without the frameworks. Once the foundations are laid, chapters 4 through 8 
rebuild the application in a Model-View Pattern with React using Material UI.  Typescript and Unit Testing are introduced as critical elements of writing 
high quality code. 

At the conclusion of this course, a developer will have an understanding and recognition not only of common patterns utilized when building react 
applications, but an appreciation for the how and why behind those patterns.

## Using This Course

This course can be performed as a self study, or as a guided course led by an
experienced developer.  The preferred way to utilize the course is for the student
to fork the repository and open the forked repo in a Github Codespace.  

At the beginning of each chapter, the student will checkout the git branch associated
with that chapter.  The branch will be a clean starting point for the development
exercises within that chapter.  As the student progresses through the chapter they 
should commit their work to the branch.  At the conclusion of the chapter, the 
student can checkout or diff against the chapter solution branch and study any 
differences.
